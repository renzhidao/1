## What AllTrans does

It replaces **all text in an app** in a language from one language to another at runtime.

Say for example an app is in German. A user selects the app name, and the required language conversion (say German to English).

Then whenever the user uses the required app, all the text, **ANYWHERE** in the app, are replaced by their English equivalents.

This is something similar to the way Google Translate works in Chrome.

**Note** - Due to a technical limitation, this won't work with many games. Nothing can be done about this.

## How to use AllTrans

This application **requires** you to sign up for **free** a key from Microsoft or Yandex Translate. See instructions below on how to get the keys.

Yandex Translate supports more languages, has a much easier signup process, and requires **NO CREDIT CARD**.

Microsoft Translate gives **better translations**, but requires a credit card to sign up. (But don't worry, nothing will be charged.)

1. Make sure AllTrans app is enabled in Xposed Installer -> Modules.
1. Launch AllTrans app. In "Global Settings" tab, enable "Use Yandex instead of Microsoft" if you want to use Yandex. Disable to use Microsoft.
2. Choose the "Translate from Language" and "Translate to Language".
3. In the "Apps to Translate" tab, find the app you want to translate, click the checkbox next to it. If the checkbox is not visible, try rotating your phone sideways into LandScape mode.
4. Close and restart the app you want translated - it should be translated!

3. Add a "Microsoft Translator API Subscription" to your Azure account.

  2. Select the "+ New" option.
  3. Select "Intelligence" from the list of services.
  4. Select "Cognitive Services APIs".

The subscription key is something like "321dcba...."

## TroubleShooting

### No app is being translated in any app

* If no app is being translated, check is "AllTrans" is enabled in Xposed Installer -> Modules.
* Also check if your "Microsoft/Yandex Subscription Key" is correct.

### Translated app is stuck in opening screen

* Click on the app's name in "Apps to translate" tab, and click on "Click to Clear Translation Cache".
* If this is the first time you started translating this app, click on the app's name in "Apps to Translate" tab, and in "Other Settings" fill in "Delay Before Replcaing With Translated Text" to 2000.

### The Translated app is "Force Close"

* Click on the app's name in "Apps to translate" tab, and click on "Click to Clear Translation Cache".
* Click on the app's name in "Apps to Translate" tab, and in "Other Settings" fill in "Delay Before Replcaing With Translated Text" to 2000.
* Click on the app's name in "Apps to translate" tab, and in "Other Settings" fill in "Delay Before Starting to Translate WebViews" to 2000.

### A particular app is not being translated

* Click on the app's name in "Apps to translate" tab, and in "Other Settings" fill in "Delay Before Starting to Translate WebViews" to 2000.
* If some parts of the app are still not being translated, click on the app's name in "Apps to translate" tab, and enable "Aggressive Mode".

### A game app is not being translated

* Due to technical limitations, "AllTrans" will not work with many games. Nothing can be done about this.

### If you still have problems like "Force Close" or parts of an app not being translated

Contact me for support. When you do, I will need atleast the following information - 

1. The name of the app, along with a **link to download the app** from some APK store like Google Play Store, CoolApk, etc.
2. Your phone's Android version.
3. A "logcat" of you trying to open the app which gives you problems. You can use apps freely available on the Play Store for this, such as [This one](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nolanlawson.logcat)

Once you have the above, contact me on the  [XDA support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/xposed-alltrans-completely-translate-t3539878).
You can also report issues on the  [Project's Github](https://github.com/akhilkedia/AllTrans).
